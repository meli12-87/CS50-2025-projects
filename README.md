# CS50-2025-projects

This repository contains all of my work for Harvard's CS50 course.  
Each week's assignments and problem sets are organized into separate folders to keep everything clear and easy to follow.

## 🎯 Purpose
I'm using this repo to document my progress throughout the course and to keep track of all the projects I complete and also make a resume.  
It also serves as a place where I can revisit older work and see how my skills improve over time.

## 🚀 How to Run
Depending on the project:

### C Programs
```bash
make filename
./filename

#### Python
python3 file.py

##### HTML/CSS/JS

Open the index.html file in your browser.
