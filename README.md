CS50-2025-Projects

This repository contains all of my work for Harvard’s CS50 course.

This repo is where I track my progress through the course, document my solutions, and build a portfolio I can later showcase in my résumé.

If you want, I can make it even more “GitHub aesthetic,” add badges, or rewrite it in a more recruiter-friendly tone.
