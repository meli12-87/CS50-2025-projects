Question:
If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
-If a user gravitates toward high-energy, danceable tracks with positive tones,
it suggests a clear preference for upbeat and uplifting music.
-Also, the key of a song can be highly influential,
as different musical keys shape the emotional character and overall feel of a track.

Question:
Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
-Maybe one is not enough to calculate this auro. It could be a longer time frame.
-It could be better to analyze a longer period, spanning multiple years,
to capture how their musical preferences have evolved and remained consistent.
